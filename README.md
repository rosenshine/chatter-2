I used Sinatra to build the backend and the routing infrastructure.

To implement the websocket I used (https://github.com/simulacre/sinatra-websocket)[sinatra-websocket], which is used in the ApplicationController to push messages to all open sockets.

On the frontend I used Bootstrap for some quick styling.
